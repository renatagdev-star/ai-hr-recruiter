# Backend (main.py)

The `main.py` file is **intentionally excluded** from this repository.

It contains the core application logic, including:
- AI prompt logic and decision flow
- Candidate ranking and follow-up generation logic
- Email automation workflow
- Security-sensitive environment configuration

This logic represents the **core value of the project** and is therefore **not shared publicly or for free**.
